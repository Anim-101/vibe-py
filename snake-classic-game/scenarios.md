### Advanced Strategies  
1. **Spiral patterns**: Create expanding spirals to maximize space usage
2. **Edge hugging**: Use screen edges to create longer safe paths
3. **Corner safety**: Corners are good places to collect bonus food
4. **Stage planning**: Remember you need 25 total foods for victory
5. **Audio feedback**: Use sound cues to confirm successful food collection

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Audio Issues
- **No sound**: Check if pygame is installed (`pip install pygame`)
- **Low volume**: Use + key to increase volume or check system audio
- **Missing music**: Restart game to reinitialize audio system
